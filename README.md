The goal of this project was to make the Nashville, Tennessee housing dataset more accessible for analysis. 
To achieve this, the raw data was processed using SQL Server and various data transformation techniques were applied.

- Importing the data into SQL Server
- Modifying the table's structure using ALTER TABLE and CONVERT functions
- Manipulating string values with functions such as PARSENAME and REPLACE
- Generated Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and implemented the ISNULL function to manage NULL values.
- Retrieving unique values using the DISTINCT keyword
- Eliminating duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy and uniqueness
- Removing columns that are irrelevant to our analysis

The project demonstrated proficiency in SQL Server and data transformation techniques, 
resulting in a well-structured and cleansed dataset that is ready for further analysis and exploration.
