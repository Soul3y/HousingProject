-- Hello, please find below the code I have written and the process I went through to explore covid data in SQL


SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidVaccinations

SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null



-- Select Data that we are going to be using

SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null



-- Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Shows likelyhood of dying if you contract covid in your country

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE location = 'France'
AND continent is not null
ORDER BY date



-- Looking at total cases vs population
-- Shows what percentage of population got Covid

SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, (total_cases/population)*100 AS CasePercentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE location = 'France'
AND continent is not null
ORDER BY date



-- Looking at countries with highest infection rate compare to population

SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS CasePercentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
GROUP BY Location, Population
ORDER BY CasePercentage DESC



-- Showing countries with highest death count & rate compare to population
-- total_deaths column has the wrong data type I have to convert it in numerical

SELECT location, population, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeathCount, MAX((total_deaths/population))*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
GROUP BY Location, Population
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC



-- Let's break things down by continent (CORRECT WAY)
-- Showing continent with the highest death count per population
-- Problem with the location data (mention income)

SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is null
AND location not LIKE '%income%'
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC



-- Problem with the location data (mention income)

SELECT date, population, new_cases, total_cases, (new_cases/population)*100 AS NewCasesPercentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE Location = 'France'
ORDER BY NewCasesPercentage DESC



-- GLOBAL NUMBERS
-- new_deaths need to be cast into numerical (nvarchar)

SELECT date, SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) AS total_deaths, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int))/SUM(New_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
GROUP BY Date
ORDER BY Date



--GLOBAL NUMBERS deaths and DeathPercentage

SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS global_total_cases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) AS global_total_deaths, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int))/SUM(New_cases)*100 AS global_death_percentage
FROM PortfolioProjects.dbo.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
